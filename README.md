# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
Credit card fraud is a major problem that costs millions of dollars each year. Machine learning algorithms can now be used to detect fraud in real time. This project proposes a system that uses machine learning models to identify credit card fraud. The project team collected transactional data from various sources, preprocessed it, extracted features, selected machine learning models, trained them, and evaluated their performance. The experimental environment was designed to ensure that the machine learning models could reliably, accurately, and efficiently identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The researchers used a variety of machine learning models, performance metrics, and evaluation methods to assess the system's performance. The results showed that the proposed methodology could identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall rates. Implementing the proposed credit card fraud detection system in an environment would allow monitoring of credit card transactions helping to identify any suspicious or fraudulent activities as they occur. Such a system would be instrumental in reducing losses safeguarding customers and enhancing the reputation of institutions. In conclusion, the proposed machine learning model-based credit card fraud detection system has the potential to significantly improve the security of credit card transactions and reduce the risk of fraud. To sum up this project suggests utilizing a machine learning model based system to detect credit card fraud, with precision and recall rates. When implemented in real time monitoring scenarios it has the potential to significantly enhance the security of credit card transactions while minimizing the risk of incidents.
